Javascript is the programimg language, Javascript can Update and change both HTML and CSS.
Javascript can Calculate, Manipulate and Validate date.

## Variables

A Variable is a container that store a value

The Value of a Javascript Variable can be changed during the excution of a program

var a = 5;      // Declaring variable
let a = 5;      // Declaring variable

a is a Identifire
5 is a literal


## var and let in Javascript

1. var is globaly scoped while let & const are block scoped.
2. var can be updated & re-decleared within its scope.
3. let can be updated but not re-decleared.
4. const can neither be update nor be re-decleared.


## Primitive Data Types & Non-Primitive Data Types

primitive data types are a set of basic data types in Javascript.

Non-primitive is a object in Javascript.

#### These are the 5 primitive datatype in Javascript

- Null
- Number
- String
- Undefined
- Boolen


#### These are the 3 Non-primitive datatype in Javascript

- Regular Expressions
- object
- array



#### Types of JavaScript Operators

##### There are different types of JavaScript operators:

1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Assignment Operators
3. Comparison Operators
4. Logical Operators
5. Conditional Operators
6. Type Operators


1. Arithmetic Operators

- Addition(+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Exponentiation (**)
- Divisionv (/)
- Modulas (%)
- Increment (++)
- Decrement (--)


2. Assignment Operators

- (=)       x = y
- (+ =)     x = x + y
- (- =)     x = x - y


3. Comparison Operators

- (==)      equal to
- (===)     equal value and equal type
- (!=)	    not equal
- (!==)	    not equal value or not equal type
- (>)	    greater than
- (<)	    less than
- (>=)	    greater than or equal to
- (<=)	    less than or equal to
- (?)	    ternary operator


4. Logical Operators

- (&&)	    logical and
- (||)	    logical or
- (!)	    logical not


5. Conditional Operators

- if                Statement
- if__else          Statement
- if__else if__else Statement


6. Type Operators

- typeof	Returns the type of a variable


#### A Comment in Javascript can be writen as follows:

// This is single line comment

/* This is
    multiple line
    comment
    */

### What is javascript ?

#### JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.


### What is DOM ?

#### in this DOM we can access, create, add, remove, Replace our HTML Element from Javascript


### What are the DOM Methods ?

#### We can access HTML elements by mulitple ways for example

    1. documen.gteElementById(),

    2. document.getElementsByClassName();
        
    3. document.getElementsByTagName();

    4. document.querySelector();

    5. document.querySelectorAll();
        


### How can i access html elements in our js ?

#### In JavaScript, we can access elements by using the getElementsByName () method.


### How can we add an html tag in html template from js ?

#### 2 Ways To Add HTML Code In Javascript â€“ A Quick Guide 1 var target = document.getElementById ("ID"); 2 target.innerHTML += " CONTENTS "; By creating and inserting a new element. 3 newElement.innerHTML = "CONTENTS"; As simple as this select-insert mechanism may seem like, there are actually quite a few ways to select and insert elements.


### What is append Child ?

#### appendChild JavaScript is helps in adding elements to an object, one element after another. This function creates a text node, and then it appends it to the existing elements.


### How can  delete html element from javascript ?

#### The remove() method removes an element (or node) from the document.

    const element = document.getElementById("demo");
    element.remove();


### What is indexing in js ?

####


### How can i get perticular content in our console.log ?

####


### What s dif between undefind and null ? **

#### In JavaScript, null is a primitive value that is used to signify the intentional absence of an object value, whereas undefined is a primitive value that acts as a placeholder for a variable that has not been assigned a value. Null and undefined values are equal when compared using the JavaScript equality operator.


### How many types of opratores in Js ?

#### There are different types of JavaScript operators:

1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Assignment Operators
3. Comparison Operators
4. Logical Operators
5. Conditional Operators
6. Type Operators



### What is the dif between == and === ?

#### == is used for comparison between two variables irrespective of the datatype of variable. === is used for comparision between two variables but this will check strict type, which means it will check datatype and compare two values. Let's take the example of each one by one.


### What is Data types ?

#### JavaScript has primitive and non-primitive data structures. Primitive data structures and data types are native to the programming language. These include boolean, null, number, string, etc... These include linear data structures, static data structures, and dynamic data structures, like queue and linked lists.


### What is Dif between typeof and instanceof Oprator in js ? **

#### The instanceof operator tests whether the prototype property of a constructor appears anywhere in the prototypes chain of an object. In most cases this mean that the object was created by using this constructor or on of its descendant. The typeof operator tests whether value belong to one of six basic types: "number", "string", "boolean", "object", "function" or "undefined". Where the string "object" belong all objects (except functions, which are objects, but have its own value in typeof operator), and also "null" value and arrays (for "null" it's a bug, but this bug is so old, so it's become a standard).


### How can i compare  and add conditions in js ? **

#### 


### What is Let, const, var ?

#### Let, const, var is a variable. A variable is a contaner that store a value. var is globally scoped while let & const are block scoped. Var can be uploaded & re-decleared within its scope. let can be update but not re-decleared. const can neither be update and nor be re-decleared.


### What is Function ?

#### function is bunch of js code.in function we can able to fetch output when we call the function, in function we can create a seprate block of js code. in function we can craete one time and we can use multiple times. where we need same code. we can call our function when another function is call.
