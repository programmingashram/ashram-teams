## CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)

#### CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document.

USE CSS
CSS is used to define style for your web pages. Including the design layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.


### CSS Selector

A CSS Selector select the HTML element(s) you want to style.

We can divide CSS selector into three categories:

* Simple Selectors 
* Combinator Selector
* Pseudo Selector

#### Note:- An Id and Class Cannot start with a Number.

### 1. Simple Selectors

Simple Selectors - select elements based in name, id and class.

All CSS Simple Selectors
#id, .class, element.class, *, element, element,element


### 2. Combinator Selectors

A combinator is something that explains the relationship between the selectors.

There are four different combinators in CSS:
* Descendant selector (space)         -  element element
* Child selector (>)                  -  element>element  
* Adjacent sibling selector (+)       -  element+element
* General sibling selector (~)        -  element~element


### 3. Pseudo Selectors

A Pseudo Selectors is used to define a special state of an element.

All Pseudo elements

:active, :checked, :disabled, :empty, :enabled, :first-child, :focus, :hover, :invalid, :link, :nth-child(n), :required, :root, :target, :valid, :visited, ::after, ::before


### Three ways to insert CSS

* External CSS
* Internal CSS
* Inline CSS


#### 1. External CSS

With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.


#### 2. Internal CSS

An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.

The internal style is defined inside the <style> element, inside the head section.


#### 3. Inline CSS

An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.

To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.


#### The CSS background properties are used to add background effects for elements.

##### CSS Background properties:

* background-color
* background-image
* background-repeat
* background-attachment
* background-position
* background (Shorthand property)


#### opacity/ Transparency

The opacity property Specifies the opecity/ transparency of an element. It can take a value from 0.0 - 1.0 The lower value, the more transparet.

##### Note:- When using the opacity propery to add transparency to the background of an element all of its child element inherit the same transparency. This can make the text inside a fully transparent element hand to read.

If we don't want to apply opacity to child element, use RGBA color

background: rgba(0, 128, 0, 0.3);

0.3 is opacity value.


#### CSS Borders

The CSS border Properties allow you to specify the style-width, and color of an element's border.

To shorten the code, The border property is a shorthand property for the following individual border properties:

* border-width
* border-style(required)
* border-color

exp:- p{
    border: 5px solid red;
}

The border-radius property is used to add rounded borders to an element:


### CSS margins

Margins are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.

margin- Individual sides

CSS has properties for specifying the margin for each side of an element:

* margin-top
* margin-right
* margin-bottom
* margin-left


All the margin properties can have the following value:

* auto- the browser calculates the margin.
* lengh- Specifies a margin in px, pt, cm etc.
* %- Specifies a margin in % of the width of the containing element.
* inherit- Specifies that the margin should be inherited from the parent element.

##### Tip:- Negative values are allowed.

Margin- a shorthand property for setting all the margin properties in one declaration.


##### Padding- 

Padding is used to create space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders.

Padding individul sides:

* padding-top
* padding-right
* padding-bottom
* padding-left

padding shorthand property

To shorthand the code, it is possiable to specify all the padding properties in one property.

##### The CSS height & width properties are used to set the height and width of an element.

##### The CSS max-width property is used to set the maximum width of an element.

CSS height & width value

* auto- This is default. The browser calculates the height & width.
* lengh- Defines the height/ width in px, pt, cm etc.
* %- Defines the height/ width in % of the width of the containing element.
* initial- sets the height/ width to its default value.
* inherit- Defines the height/ width will be inherited from the parent value.


#### The CSS Box-Model

In CSS, the term "box-model" is used when talking about design and layout.

The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of margin, border, padding and the actual conten. 

Explamintion of the different parts:
* content- The content of the box, where text and images appear.
* padding- clears an area around the content. The padding is transpared.
* border- A border that goes around the padding an content.
* margin- Clears an area outside tha border. The margin is transparent

The Box Model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements.

#### OUTLINE

An outline is a line drown outsid the elements border.

The outline property is a shorthand property for setting the following individual outline properties

* outline-width
* outline-style(required)
* outine-color


##### The text-align property is used to set the horizontal alignment of a text.

a text can be left or right aligned, centred or justified


#### Text-shadow

the text-shadow property adds shadow to text. In its simplest use, you only specify the horizontal shadow and vertical shadow.
we also can add some color and blur effect.

text-shadow: horizontal, vertical, blur, color;


#### The display property

The "display" specifies if/ how an element is displayed.

Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is. The default display value for most elements is block or inline.

#### display: none;

Hiding an elements can be done by setting the display property to none. The element will be hidden, and tha page will be displayed as if the element is not there.

#### visibility: hiidden;

also hidden an element
However, the element will still take up the same space as before. The element will be hidden, but still effect the layout.
